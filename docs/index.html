A list in python is similar to a string. It's a sequence of values. 

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

The difference between strings and lists is that the string requires them to be characters:

```python
a = "this is a string of characters"
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Whereas a list can be anything and starts with a '[' and ends with a '[]':

```python
a = ['a', list, 0, ['any','little','thing'], you[0], can["think"], "of", True]
```
<aside class="notes"><p>Values are separated by commas. 
As you can see, you can have a list inside a list. This is called a nested list.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

You also may find that you need to create a new list that is empty:

```python
a = []
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

You then can add items to it.

```python
a = []
a.append("item")
# a = ["item"]
```

<aside class="notes"><p>We&#39;ll talk about methods more in a bit</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Lists in python are mutable and you can do all kinds of odd things with them because of it (as well as some expected things).

```python
numbers = [1,2,3]
secondNum = number[1]
numbers = [numbers[0],numbers[2]]
otherSecondNum = numbers.pop(1)
# numbers = [1]
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Meaning they can be changed vs an immutable object which cannot.
We can start with a pretty normal list of numbers. Lets say we only wanted the second one.
We then can remove the number by redefining the list, but there is a better way to do this. 
Pop is the method to do this. It removes it from the list and assigns it to what you choose.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

We saw this last chapter, but you can also traverse lists.

```python
cheeses = ["havarti", "cheddar", "american", "gouda"]
for cheese in cheeses:
    print(cheese)
# havarti
# ...
# gouda
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

There are other ways to do this as well.

```python
cheeses = ["havarti", "cheddar", "american", "gouda"]
for i in range(len(cheeses)):
    print(cheeses[i])
# havarti
# ...
# gouda
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Range creates a new interable with numbers from zero up to the number you specify.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

If you traverse and empty list, nothing will happen.

```python
for x in []:
    print("This will never happen.")
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Although you can have nested lists, if you pull the list out of the list, it's still a list. 

```python
a = ['a', list, 0, ['any','little','thing'], you[0], can["think"], "of", True]
print(a[3])
# ['any','little','thing']
print(a[3][1])
# 'little'
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

There are also two operations you can do to lists. Add and multiply.

```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
c = a + b
# c = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
d = a * 4
# d = [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Just like strings, you can also slice lists.

```python
c = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
a = c[:2]
# a = [1,2,3]
b = c[3:]
# b = [4,5,6]
e = c[:]
# e = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

What about list methods. We know about pop... what else is there?

```python
t = ['a','b','c']
t.append('d')
# t = ['a','b','c','d']
u = ['f','e']
t.extend[u]
# t = ['a','b','c','d','f','e']
t.sort()
# # t = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Something to keep in mind: most methods modify the referenced list and return None.

```python
y = t.sort()
# y = None
```

# 
# 1. Write a function named "version1" that reads the file words.txt 
# and builds a list with one element per word. Write a second version

#
</code></pre>


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Another thing you might want to do with a list is add all the numbers together.

```python
a = [1,2,3]

def add_all(num):
    total = 0
    for x in num:
        total += x     # total = x + total
    return total
x = add_all(a)
# x = 6
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This is called sometimes an accumulator.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

This is a common function so python actually has a built-in function to do it.

```python
a = [1,2,3]

x = sum(a)
# x = 6
```

#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "nested_sum" should output a integer that is a sum of all integers
# in the nested lists.
#
# 1. Write a function called nested_sum that takes a list of lists of integers 
# and adds up the elements from all of the nested lists. For example:
#
# >>> t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]
# >>> nested_sum(t)
# 21
#
</code></pre>

Sometimes you want to traverse a list and make a new one concurrently.

```python
def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Because this starts with an empty list and adds to it, it can also be called an accumulator.
This could be called a map as well because it maps the .capitalize method on each of the elements</p>

# Exercise 10.2
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "cum_sum" should output a list of integers that is a stepping 
# cumlative sum of all integers in the nested lists.
#
# 1. Write a function called cum_sum that takes a list of numbers and returns the
# cumulative sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the 
# first i + 1 elements from the original list. For example:
# 
# >>> t = [1, 2, 3]
# >>> cumsum(t)
# [1, 3, 6]
#

# Exercise 10.3
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "middle" should output all list elements, but first and last. 
#
# 1. Write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list 
# that contains all but the first and last elements. For example:
#
# >>> t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# >>> middle(t)
# [2, 3]
#
</code></pre>


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

You can do similar and return a sublist instead of all the contents:

```python
def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

It also is possible to remove elements from a list. We've seen pop() which will remove, but there are other ways to do it that do not return anything.

```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
del t[1]       # if you know the index
# t = ['a','c']
t.remove('c')  # if you know the value
```
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

You can also remove a multiple items with a slice.

```python
t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del t[1:5]
# t = ['a', 'f']
```

# Exercise 10.4
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "chop" should remove first and last element in-place. 
#
# 1. Write a function called chop that takes a list, modifies it by removing the
# first and last elements, and returns None. For example:
#
# >>> t = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# >>> chop(t)
# >>> t
# [2, 3]
#

We talked earlier that a string is a sequence of characters. If we want this to be a list, there a few easy ways to do so depending on what result you want.

```python
s = 'spam'
t = list(s)
# t = ['s','p','a','m']
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

list breaks the string down to characters. If you want to convert to words, you can use split().

```python
s = 'I like spam'
t = s.split()
# t = ['I', 'like', 'spam']
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

By default split() uses space as a delimiter, but you can specify anything you wish.

```python
s = 'I-like-spam'
t = s.split('-')
# t = ['I', 'like', 'spam']
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

There is also the inverse of split(), join()

```python
s = ['I', 'like', 'spam']
t = s.join()
# t = 'I like spam'   # by default, it uses spaces as the delimiter
u = s.join('-')
# t = 'I-like-spam'   # you can change it the same way as split()
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Some logic that might throw you off lies in the memory assignment of variables.

```python
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'
print(a is b)       # is operator compares the objects and not the values
# True              a is the same object as b

a = [1,2,3]
b = [1,2,3]
print(a is b)
# False             a is not the same object as b
```

<aside class="notes"><p>Python tries to be smart with memory management. If the string values are the same, they will be the same object until changed.
With lists, the list will be a different object.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

This leads us to aliasing. Aliasing is not much of a problem with strings, but with lists, it can definitely be.

```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = a        # creates an alias to a
print(a is b)
# True
```

<aside class="notes"><p>This object is called a reference. If the referenced object is mutable, changes to one will make changes to another.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Along the same lines as above, when you pass a list to a function, it will send a reference to the list. The list will then be modified as the reference is modified.

```python
def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]
    
letters = ['a','b','c']
delete_head(letters)
# letters = ['b','c']
```

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

There is also a bad way to do this.

```python
def bad_delete_head(t):
    t = t[1:]
    
letters = ['a','b','c']
bad_delete_head(letters)
# letters = ['a','b','c']
```

<aside class="notes"><p>you are making a new t in the fuction and it is removing the reference.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

You can use this to your advantage if you don't want to modify the existing list.

```python
def tail(t):
    return t[1:]
letters = ['a','b','c']
rest = tail(letters)
print(letters)
# ['a','b','c']
print(rest)
# [b','c']
```

# Exercise 10.10
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "in_bisect" should return the index in list where the word was
# found
# 
# 1. To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use the in operator,
# but it would be slow because it searches through the words in order. Because 
# the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up with a bisection 
# search (also known as binary search), which is similar to what you do when you
# look a word up in the dictionary. You start in the middle and check to see 
# whether the word you are looking for comes before the word in the middle of 
# the list. If so, you search the first half of the list the same way. Otherwise
# you search the second half.
# 
# Either way, you cut the remaining search space in half. If the word list has
# 113,809 words, it will take about 17 steps to find the word or conclude that
# it's not there.
#
# Write a function called in_bisect that takes a sorted list and a target value
# and returns the index of the value in the list if it's there, or None if it's 
# not.
